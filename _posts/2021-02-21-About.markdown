I'm Aiden, I am currently undertaking my PhD in Deep Learning, focussing on Unsupervised and Self-Supervised visual representational learning. Drop me an email or message if you are interested in anything I post about!

I received my BSc (Hons) Computer Science from the University of Lincoln, with my undergraduate research project focussing on the understanding of Machine Learning principles applied to binary classification of Parkinson's disease from MRI brain scans. I was awarded Best BSc Graduate for achieving the highest overall grade in the class of 2018, (1/154).

My began MPhil/PhD at the University of Lincoln, supervised by [Georgios Leontidis](https://www.abdn.ac.uk/people/georgios.leontidis/) and [Stefanos Kollias](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-h2va3cAAAAJ&hl=en). I was awarded my MPhil in September 2019 and since then I have transferred to University of Aberdeen continuing my PhD under the supervision of Georgios Leontidis and [Mingjun Zhong](https://www.abdn.ac.uk/people/mingjun.zhong).

Additionally, whilst at the University of Lincoln I worked as a Research Assistant on the CORe monitoring Techniques and EXperimental validation and demonstration (CORTEX). This involves the development of Machine Learning systems for the nuclear reactor in-core anomaly detection from induced neutron flux detector readings. The work achieved on this project contributes towards my PhD. For more details of the CORTEX project, please see: ([CORTEX](http://cortex-h2020.eu/))

More recently, I have been working as an early career researcher at the University of Glasgow as part of the Internet of Food Things (IoFT) working group on Data Sharing and Interoperability for data trusts in the agrifood sector. We are investigating the potential technological solutions to challenges posed by data sharing within the agri-food sector. ([IoFT WG: Data Trust](https://ioftdatatrustwg.github.io/))
