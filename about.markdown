I'm Aiden, I am currently undertaking my PhD in Deep Learning, interested in Unsupervised and Self-Supervised visual representational learning. Drop me an email or message if you are interested in anything I post about!

I received my BSc (Hons) Computer Science from the University of Lincoln, with my undergraduate research project focussing on the understanding of Machine Learning pricinciples applied to binary classification of Parkinson's disease from MRI brain scans. I was awarded Best BSc Graduate for achieving the highest overall grade in the class of 2018, (1/154).

My began MPhil/PhD at the University of Lincoln, supervised by [Georgios Leontidis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/georgios-leontidis-phd-fhea-2775123a/) and [Stefanos Kollias](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-h2va3cAAAAJ&hl=en). I was awarded my MPhil in September 2019 and I am continuing my PhD at the University of Aberdeen, with the same supervisors.

At the University of Lincoln I work as a Research Assistant on the CORe monitoring Techniques and EXperimental validation and demonstration (CORTEX). This involves the development of Machine Learning systems for the nuclear reactor in-core anomaly detection from induced neutron flux detector readings. The work achieved on this project contributes towards my PhD. For more details of the CORTEX project, please see: ([CORTEX](http://cortex-h2020.eu/))

During my free time I play golf and enjoy film photography, although my passion outweights my abiliy. I have a keen interest in motorsport, with a background in kart racing.
